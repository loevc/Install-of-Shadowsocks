## The process how to install & use
```pip install shadowsocks
vim /etc/shadowsocks.json 
```
shadowsocks.json
```
{
"server":"0.0.0.0",
"server_port":xxxx,   # choose a  port from 1025-65535
"local_port":1080,

[program:shadowsocks]
command=ssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks.json
autostart=true
autorestart=true

logfile=/var/log/shadowsocks.log   #for  different kernelï¼Œthe file maybe not exist
```
```
vim /etc/rc.local
```

the command reboot can use "**init6**" or  "**reboot**"

```
ssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks.json -d start
```



test bbr 
```
sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control
sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control
```


i found a thing that the server will go slowly by the system running away.
reboot the system will solve this problem , maybe it products a lot caches.
how to reboot nobody ?
i search a method 
use the crontab

let 
```
cat /etc/crontab

```
the first open it  ,
there will have a doc to tell you this's format

```
vim /etc/crontab
```
to add below cotent

```
15 04 * * 1 root reboot
20 04 * * 1 root /usr/local/bin/ssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks.json -d start
```

then to reboot the server crontab
```
systemctl restart crond.service
```
the  crond  have other parameter that "reload  start"
